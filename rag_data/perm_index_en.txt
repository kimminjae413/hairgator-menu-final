## 02. ☆ Softening - Moisture - Temperature

Okay, here's a detailed breakdown of the image, focusing on the information relevant to a professional hairstylist and using appropriate terminology:

**Overall Topic:** Softening, Moisture, and Temperature in Heating Perms

**1. Textual Content Breakdown:**

*   **Title:** "Softening / Moisture / Temperature" - This sets the stage for the three key elements discussed in the context of heating perms.

    *   **Softening:**
        *   **a. What is softening?** - Defines softening as the process where hair loses elasticity due to the breakdown of hydrogen, salt, and cystine bonds by the reducing agents, alkali agents, and solvents in the first perm solution. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing softening from emulsification.
        *   **b. What are the standards for softening test?** - Explains that the success of softening in a heating perm is assessed after the second perm solution is applied, similar to a curl test in cold perms. It highlights the difficulty in standardizing the test due to individual variations and suggests monitoring the chemical reaction time of the first perm solution.

    *   **Moisture:**
        *   **a. The Role of Moisture in a Heating Perm** - Explains that moisture acts as a medium for heat transfer in heating perms, including straight, curl, and wave designs.
        *   **b. Why Moisture is Controlled** - Discusses the importance of controlling moisture levels to prevent protein denaturation and hardening due to excessive heat. It emphasizes maintaining a balance of moisture and oil for hydration and protection.
        *   **c. Standard of Moisture Control** - Highlights the importance of moisture control in heating perms, especially for curls and waves. It acknowledges the lack of a standardized approach and emphasizes assessing moisture content based on hair condition (healthy or damaged).
        *   **d. How to Control Moisture** - Suggests using towels, cold air, or warm air to control moisture levels and recommends using moisturizing agents to maintain initial moisture.
        *   **e. Amount of Moisture by Hair Condition (Bonding Water, Free Water, Permeable Water, and Absorbed Water)** - This section presents a table (see below).

    *   **Temperature:**
        *   **a. Understanding Heat Control** - Stresses the importance of setting the temperature based on the hair condition and controlling the heat generated by the heat tool.
        *   **b. Standards for Temperature Setting** - Explains that temperature standards vary depending on whether the heating element reaches the set temperature (hair straightener or curling iron) or not (wave machine). It provides temperature guidelines for moist and dry heat.
        *   **c. Standards for Moisture Content By Set Temperatures** - This section presents a table (see below).
        *   **d. Directions for Controlling Heat** - Provides specific directions for controlling heat during straight/curl straightening, ironing, and setting/digital perms.

*   **Concluding Statement:** "Moisture and temperature cannot be controlled particular to healthy or damaged hair for a heating perm. The solution uses the appropriate 1st perm solution and treatment per hair condition and by controlling the heat generated by the heat tool." - This summarizes the key takeaway: successful heating perms rely on the correct first perm solution, treatment, and heat control based on hair condition.

**2. Diagram Explanation:**

*   **Moisture and Heat Balance:** The diagram shows a balance scale with "Moisture" on one side and "Heat (Energy)" on the other. This visually represents the critical relationship between moisture and heat in a heating perm. The fulcrum of the scale suggests that a balance must be achieved for optimal results. Too much heat with too little moisture can damage the hair, while insufficient heat with excessive moisture may not achieve the desired perm.

**3. Table Explanations:**

## 03. ☆ Swelling - Softening - Oxidation Method

Okay, let's break down this image detailing the swelling, softening, and oxidation method in a perm process.

**1. Textual Elements:**

*   **Title:** "03 ☆ Swelling / Softening / Oxidation Method" - This indicates that the image is part of a larger series (likely a training manual) and focuses on the core chemical processes involved in perming.

*   **Pre-Shampoo:** "Remove impurities by shampooing first." - This is the initial step to ensure the hair is clean and free of buildup, allowing for even penetration of subsequent chemicals.

*   **Acidic Thioglycolic Acid / Acidic Cysteine:** "Before swelling, spray either acidic thioglycolic acid or acidic cysteine." - These are reducing agents that break the disulfide bonds (S-S bonds) in the hair's keratin structure. This allows the hair to be reshaped.

*   **Swelling:** "This step is to open the hair cuticle before softening to ensure stable softening." - Swelling agents are used to lift the hair cuticle, allowing the reducing agent to penetrate more effectively.

*   **How to prepare the swelling agent:** This section details the mixing ratios for the swelling agent.

*   **Softening:** "This refers to the cleaved S-S bond through chemical action. The softening time must be longer for soft hair as the hairs have less S-S bonding and hardened cuticles." - Softening is the process of breaking the disulfide bonds in the hair's keratin structure, allowing it to be reshaped. The softening time is adjusted based on hair type and condition.

*   **Liposome:** "This process involves preheating with a press at around 80 to 100 degrees Celsius. It enables the perm solution to permeate into the hair cortex and retain moisture." - Liposomes are used to deliver the perm solution deeper into the hair cortex while retaining moisture.

*   **pH Balance:** "The pH balance is sprayed to adjust the primary isoelectric point before shampooing." - This step involves adjusting the pH of the hair to prepare it for the next stage of the perming process.

*   **Dead Thioglycolic Acid:** "This is when the perm solution has completed its activation in the softening. Then bubbles or foams are generated which is referred to as dead thioglycolic acid. Stable softening can be achieved by shampooing after combing out the dead thioglycolic acid using a tail comb to remove the perm solution. In addition, the purified water and PPT must be mixed in a 9:1 ratio and sprayed to comb out and remove the dead thioglycolic acid." - This refers to the neutralized or deactivated thioglycolic acid after it has done its job. It needs to be removed to prevent further damage.

*   **Isoelectric Shampoo:** "A shampooing step to reach a stable isoelectric point." - This shampoo is used to bring the hair back to its isoelectric point, which is the pH at which the hair is most stable.

*   **Heating Perm:** "Magic straight, Digital Perm, or Setting Perm" - This indicates that the process can be applied to various types of perms, including thermal reconditioning (straightening) and traditional perms.

*   **Oxidation:** "This refers to the rebounding of the S-S bond that was cleaved through chemical action. Spray the mixed 1st oxidizing agent (oxidizing agent 7: purified water 3 + anionic surfactant 10%). Spray the 100% 2nd oxidizing agent." - Oxidation is the process of reforming the disulfide bonds in the hair's new shape, essentially "setting" the perm. Oxidizing agents (typically hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate) are used.

*   **Shampoo:** "The final shampoo should be in the direction of the curl." - This is the final cleansing step, and the direction of the shampooing can help to define the curl pattern.

*   **Shape Softening:** "Softening extremely curly hair refers to applying the perm solution to 100% dry hair for softening." - This is a specific technique for softening extremely curly hair by applying the perm solution to dry hair.

*   **Directions for Increasing Reduction Effects:** This section details the steps to increase the reduction effects of the perm solution.

## 05. ★ Heating Perm Recipe #2

Okay, let's break down this "Heating Perm Recipe #2" guide for extremely damaged hair, focusing on the technical aspects relevant to professional hairstylists.

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents a series of hair perming recipes (Recipe No. 7 through Recipe No. 11), each tailored for extremely damaged hair. Each recipe outlines a step-by-step process, indicating the order of product application and techniques. The arrows indicate the sequence of steps.

**Detailed Breakdown of Each Recipe:**

**Recipe No. 7: If Extremely Damaged Hair (7)**

*   **Apply LPP to Damaged Areas:** LPP (Low Molecular Weight Protein) is used to fill in the gaps in the hair's cuticle, providing a base for subsequent treatments. This step aims to improve the hair's porosity and strength.
*   **Apply Cysteamine + Oil Clinic / 5 minutes:** Cysteamine is a reducing agent, similar to thioglycolate, but generally considered milder. The oil clinic helps to protect the hair during the chemical process. The 5-minute application time suggests a gentle approach.
*   **Shampoo:** Removes the previous treatment and prepares the hair for the next step.
*   **Swelling 2 (+ Oil Clinic 20%):** This step likely refers to a product designed to swell the hair shaft, opening the cuticle for better penetration of subsequent treatments. The addition of 20% oil clinic aims to mitigate damage during the swelling process.
*   **Thioglycolic Acid (Alkali) for Damaged Hair:** Thioglycolic acid is a stronger reducing agent than cysteamine. Using an alkaline version helps to open the hair cuticle for better penetration.
*   **Thioglycolic Acid (Alkali) for Damaged Hair: Purified Water = 1:2 (+ Oil Clinic 20%):** This step involves diluting the thioglycolic acid with purified water in a 1:2 ratio, further reducing its strength. The addition of 20% oil clinic provides additional protection.
*   **Shampoo → Keratin → Treatment → Shampoo:** This sequence focuses on rebuilding the hair's structure. Keratin, a protein, helps to fill in gaps and strengthen the hair. The "Treatment" step likely involves a deep conditioning product to moisturize and repair the hair. The final shampoo removes any residue. The note "Slightly acidic product, around pH 4.5 - pH 5.5" indicates that the keratin and shampoo used in this step should be pH balanced to help close the cuticle and lock in the treatment.
*   **Liposome at 100°C:** Liposomes are microscopic vesicles that can encapsulate and deliver active ingredients into the hair shaft. Heating them to 100°C likely helps to facilitate their penetration.
*   **Magic Straightening:** This refers to the heat straightening process using a flat iron.

    *   **Description:** "It is an ingredient that prevents oxidation of the reducing agent and conditions the hair."

**Diagram Explanation (Bottle Analogy):**

The bottle graphic is a visual representation of the perming solution's composition. The different colored layers within the bottle correspond to the different ingredients and their relative proportions.

*   **Top (Dark Brown):** Represents the "Reducing Agent." This layer is the smallest, suggesting it's present in a smaller concentration compared to the other ingredients. The description explains that the reducing agent, containing thioglycolic acid (alkali) and cysteamine, breaks the disulfide bonds (cysteine bonds) in the hair's cortex. This is the core chemical process that allows the hair to be reshaped during perming. The description also mentions that the reducing agent includes a stabilizer and hair protectant.
*   **Middle (Light Brown):** Represents the "Alkali Agent." This layer is larger than the reducing agent layer, indicating a higher concentration. The description explains that the alkali agent raises the pH of the solution, causing the hair to swell and the cuticle to open. This allows the reducing agent to penetrate the cortex more effectively. The alkali agent also cleaves the ionic bonding inside the hair.
*   **Bottom (Cream):** Represents the "Stabilizer, water, etc." This layer is the largest, suggesting it's the primary component by volume. The description explains that the stabilizer prevents oxidation of the reducing agent, ensuring its effectiveness over time. Water is likely the main solvent and carrier for the other ingredients.

**Relationships and Concepts:**

*   **Synergistic Action:** The graphic illustrates the synergistic relationship between the reducing agent and the alkali agent. The alkali agent prepares the hair by swelling it and opening the cuticle, allowing the reducing agent to access and break the disulfide bonds.
*   **Importance of Stabilizers:** The inclusion of a stabilizer highlights the importance of maintaining the reducing agent's effectiveness. Oxidation can deactivate the reducing agent, leading to a poor perm result.
*   **Hair Structure:** The descriptions implicitly refer to the hair's structure (cuticle, cortex, disulfide bonds, ionic bonds) and how the perming solution interacts with these components.

**Color-Coded Areas:**

*   The different shades of brown and cream are used to visually differentiate the three main components of the perming solution. The relative size of each colored area represents the approximate proportion of each ingredient in the solution.

**In summary,** the image provides a simplified yet informative overview of the key ingredients in a hair perming solution and their roles in the perming process. It uses a visual analogy to make the information more accessible and memorable.

*   **"2nd"**: This is a label on the bottle illustration, referring to the second solution used in the perming process.
*   **"Oxidizing Agent"**: This is the primary ingredient in the 2nd perm solution.
*   **"The main ingredient of the 2nd perm solution is the oxidizing agent which enables re-bonding of the cleaved S-S bonding by oxidation."**: This is a description of the oxidizing agent's function. It highlights that the oxidizing agent is crucial for re-establishing disulfide bonds (S-S bonds) in the hair's keratin structure after they have been broken during the first step of the perming process (reduction).
*   **"Stabilizer, water, etc."**: This indicates other ingredients present in the 2nd perm solution.
*   **"A pH adjuster that maintains and stabilizes the pH; also a conditioning ingredient"**: This describes the function of the stabilizer. It emphasizes the importance of pH control for the effectiveness and safety of the perming process, as well as the inclusion of conditioning agents to help mitigate damage.

**2. Diagram Explanation:**

*   **Bottle Illustration:** The bottle visually represents the 2nd perm solution. The division of the bottle into two sections (darker and lighter) visually separates the primary ingredient (oxidizing agent) from the other ingredients (stabilizer, water, etc.).

**3. Concepts and Relationships:**

*   **Perming Process:** The image focuses on the second step of a two-step perming process.
*   **1st Step (Reduction):** In the first step, a reducing agent (e.g., ammonium thioglycolate) is used to break the disulfide bonds in the hair's keratin structure. This allows the hair to be reshaped around a perm rod.
*   **2nd Step (Oxidation):** The second step, represented in the image, involves applying an oxidizing agent (e.g., hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate). The oxidizing agent neutralizes the reducing agent and reforms the disulfide bonds in the new, desired configuration. This "locks in" the curl or wave pattern.
*   **Disulfide Bonds (S-S Bonds):** These are crucial for the hair's strength, elasticity, and shape. Breaking and reforming these bonds is the fundamental principle behind perming.
*   **Oxidizing Agent Function:** The oxidizing agent is essential for re-establishing the disulfide bonds. Without it, the hair would not hold the new shape.
*   **Stabilizer Function:** The stabilizer (pH adjuster) is important for several reasons:
    *   **Neutralization:** It helps neutralize any remaining reducing agent.
    *   **pH Control:** Maintaining the correct pH is crucial for the oxidizing agent to function effectively and to minimize damage to the hair.
    *   **Conditioning:** The inclusion of conditioning ingredients helps to restore moisture and improve the overall health of the hair after the chemical process.

**In Summary:**

The image provides a concise overview of the key ingredients and their functions in the second step of a perming process. It emphasizes the role of the oxidizing agent in re-establishing disulfide bonds, which is essential for setting the new hair shape. It also highlights the importance of stabilizers for pH control and conditioning. This information is crucial for hairstylists to understand the chemical processes involved in perming and to ensure safe and effective results.

## 10. Amino Acid Type

Okay, let's break down this table of amino acids and their properties relevant to hair perming.

**1. Text and Titles:**

*   **"10 Amino Acid Type"**: This is likely a section heading within a larger document, indicating that the following information pertains to amino acids.
*   **"Types of Amino Acids"**: This is the header for the first column of the table, indicating the specific amino acids listed.
*   **"Content (%)"**: This is the header for the second column, indicating the percentage of each amino acid present in a given context (likely hair protein, though not explicitly stated).
*   **"pH"**: This is the header for the third column, indicating the pH value associated with each amino acid.
*   **"Acidic"**: This label groups amino acids with acidic properties.
*   **"Neutral"**: This label groups amino acids with neutral properties.
*   **"Alkaline"**: This label groups amino acids with alkaline properties.
*   **Amino Acid Names**: The table lists specific amino acids: Aspartic acid, Glutamate, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Cystine, Cysteine, Tryptophan, Methionine, Lysine, and Arginine.

**2. Table Explanation:**

This table presents information about the amino acid composition and pH characteristics, which are crucial for understanding hair structure and the chemical processes involved in perming.

*   **Amino Acid Types:** The first column lists the different amino acids found in hair protein (keratin).
*   **Content (%):** The second column shows the relative abundance of each amino acid in hair. This is important because the specific amino acid composition influences the hair's physical and chemical properties. For example, a higher percentage of cystine will lead to more disulfide bonds, making the hair stronger and more resistant to perming.
*   **pH:** The third column indicates the pH associated with each amino acid. pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity. The pH of the perming solution and the hair itself are critical factors in determining the effectiveness and safety of the perming process.

**3. Amino Acid Groupings (Acidic, Neutral, Alkaline):**

*   **Acidic Amino Acids (Aspartic acid, Glutamate):** These amino acids have acidic side chains, meaning they can donate protons (H+). They contribute to the overall negative charge of hair protein at neutral pH.
*   **Neutral Amino Acids (Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Cystine, Cysteine, Tryptophan, Methionine):** These amino acids have side chains that are neither acidic nor basic at neutral pH. They contribute to the overall structure and properties of hair protein.
*   **Alkaline Amino Acids (Lysine, Arginine):** These amino acids have basic side chains, meaning they can accept protons (H+). They contribute to the overall positive charge of hair protein at neutral pH.

**4. Significance for Hair Perming:**

*   **Disulfide Bonds:** Cystine is particularly important because it forms disulfide bonds (S-S) between keratin chains. These bonds are responsible for the hair's strength and shape. Perming involves breaking and reforming these disulfide bonds to change the hair's structure.
*   **pH and Perming Solutions:** The pH of the perming solution is critical for controlling the rate of the chemical reactions that break and reform disulfide bonds. Alkaline perming solutions (high pH) cause the hair shaft to swell, allowing the reducing agent (e.g., ammonium thioglycolate) to penetrate and break the disulfide bonds. Acid perms (lower pH) are gentler but may take longer to process.
*   **Amino Acid Composition and Perming Results:** The amino acid composition of the hair can influence how well it takes a perm. Hair with a higher percentage of cystine may require a stronger or longer-lasting perming solution. Damaged hair may have a lower cystine content, making it more susceptible to damage during perming.
*   **Neutralizing:** After the hair has been reshaped, a neutralizing solution (usually hydrogen peroxide) is applied to reform the disulfide bonds in the new configuration. The pH of the neutralizing solution is also important for ensuring that the bonds are reformed correctly and that the hair is not damaged.

In summary, this table provides essential information about the amino acid composition and pH characteristics of hair, which are critical factors in understanding the chemical processes involved in perming and achieving desired results.

## 11. Base Control

Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the information relevant to hairstyling and perming techniques:

**1. Text Elements:**

*   **"11 Base Control"**: This is the title of the section, indicating that the image focuses on different base control techniques used in perming.

*   **"a. On Base"**: This is the first technique. The description states: "A base with a diameter of 1 and placed between the upper and lower parting to maximize base support; it is preferable for minimizing tension."

*   **"b. Half Off"**: This is the second technique. The description states: "Places the rod in the middle of the on base and off base."

*   **"c. Off Base"**: This is the third technique. The description states: "Keeps the rod placed off the base to minimize lifting of the base. The hair is wrapped at 45° below the center of the base."

*   **"d. Under Directed"**: This is the fourth technique. The description states: "A base with a diameter of 1.5 and the hair is wrapped at 90° from the center of the base."

*   **"e. Over Directed"**: This is the fifth technique. The description states: "The rod is placed on the top section of the base."

**2. Diagrams and Concepts:**

The image presents five different base control techniques for perming, each illustrated with two diagrams: a frontal view and a side view of a head form. These diagrams demonstrate the placement of perm rods relative to the base section of hair.

*   **a. On Base:** The perm rod is placed directly on the base section. The base diameter is 1 (presumably inches or centimeters). The description emphasizes that this placement maximizes base support and minimizes tension. This technique is used to achieve maximum volume and lift at the scalp.

*   **b. Half Off:** The perm rod is placed partially on the base and partially off the base. This technique provides a moderate amount of volume and lift.

*   **c. Off Base:** The perm rod is placed completely off the base section. The description notes that this minimizes lifting of the base and that the hair is wrapped at a 45° angle below the center of the base. This technique is used to create a softer, more relaxed curl with less volume at the scalp.

*   **d. Under Directed:** The perm rod is placed on a base with a diameter of 1.5. The hair is wrapped at a 90° angle from the center of the base. This technique is used to create a curl that is directed underneath the base, providing a more controlled and defined curl pattern.

*   **e. Over Directed:** The perm rod is placed on the top section of the base. This technique is used to create a curl that is directed over the base, providing a more dramatic and voluminous curl pattern.

**3. Arrows and Symbols:**

*   The diagrams use lines to represent the hair strands and their direction of wrapping around the perm rod.
*   The circles represent the perm rods.
*   The lines connecting the perm rods to the head form indicate the direction and angle of the hair wrap.

**4. Color-Coded Areas:**

*   The head form is gray.
*   The perm rods are orange.
*   The lines representing the hair strands are yellow.

**In Summary:**

The image provides a visual guide to different base control techniques used in perming. Each technique affects the volume, lift, and direction of the curl. The diagrams illustrate the placement of the perm rod relative to the base section of hair, and the descriptions provide additional information about the base diameter and hair wrapping angle. By understanding these techniques, hairstylists can customize the perm to achieve the desired curl pattern and volume for their clients.
